# Isaac Online Modded

This tool allows you to patch the game binary of **The Binding of Isaac** to enable mods in online co-op play without the need to disable them beforehand. 

This tool also allows you to modify the External Item Descriptions mod in a way to enable using it in coop.

**Note:** You will need to run the patch again each time the game updates.

## Warning

While this patch allows starting online co-op with any mod installed, doing so can quickly cause desync issues. It often helps if all players have the same mods installed. ***Additionally, some mods may work even if others don't have them installed, but they might require special handling.***

*For further information, see the specific subdirectories (e.g., for External Item Descriptions).*

## Disclaimer

This tool is intended for **friends-only co-op play**. While it probably works in other scenarios, those are not explicitly accounted for. **I do not condone ruining other players' experiences in online matches.**

Please use this tool responsibly and enjoy your enhanced co-op experience!
