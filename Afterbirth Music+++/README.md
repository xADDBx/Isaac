The mod itself uses the base game RNG for some things which causes a desync.
If ***everyone has the mod installed***, this mod works without changes.

***Replacing the main.lua*** of the mod with the one here will allow this mod to ***work even if only one person has it enabled***. It implements a custom RNG to prevent influencing the game state.
